         * Please be AWARE that due to inheritance it will offer you MULTIPLE
         * filters. You normally want to use the filter that needed the most
         * arguments. Failing to use the proper filter may let you process
         * messages that you did not wanted to be aware of this behavior !
         *
         * IMPORTANT: You are ALLOWED to send data during a listener callback
         * although you should avoid it because processing custom message should
         * not block.
         *
         * Furthermore if you try to send data and then wait for another reply
         * inside the listener callback (e.g with a collector) you can wait
         * FOREVER because you are blocking the thread context in which messages
