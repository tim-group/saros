     * @JTourBusStop 4, Creating custom network messages, Creating the provider:
     *
     * Each packet extension needs a provider so that the marshalled content
     * (XML output) can correctly unmarshalled again.
     *
     * Please use the exact layout as presented in this class. Create a public
     * static final field named PROVIDER. Put this field to the top of the class
     * and put the provider class itself at the bottom of the class.
     *
     * As you see the first argument in the call to the super constructor is the
     * XML element name. IMPORTANT: our logic does not check for correct XML
     * syntax so YOU have to make sure that the name is a valid XML tag.
     *
     * The element name has nothing to do with the XStream alias and can have a
     * completely different name although it MUST be unique among all other
     * packet extensions !
     *
     * The second argument is a var-arg. You must ensure that all classes of the
     * fields that are going to be marshalled are passed into the constructor.
     * Failing to do so will result in XStream annotations that are not
     * processed and so the XML output of the marshalling will not be the same
     * as what you would expected !
